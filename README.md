# Advent of Code 2020

Day 1: Report Repair
List of numbers, find the pair (part 1; triple part 2) that add up to 2020 and
the answer is their product.

Day 2: Password Philosophy
List of password rules and passwords, eg "1-3 a: abcde". Check validity.

Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory
Get a map of trees in our locale, finding how many trees we hit on our route
through it (several different routes for part 2).

Day 4: Passport Processing
Each passport has eight fields which need validating.

Day 5: Binary Boarding
Each boarding pass is ten characters, essentially binary, so each can be
converted to a number. Find largest (part 1) and the missing one which has one
lower and the one higher present.

Day 6: Custom Customs
Groups of sets of letters. Find all defferent letters in each group (part 1) and common letters in each group (part 2).

Day 7: Handy Haversacks
Lots of rules: I have a bag. Each type of bags must contain a specified number of different types of bag, recursively.

Day 8: Handheld Halting
Finding infinite loop in a program, then getting rid of it.

Day 9: Encoding Error
Find a number in a list which isn't the sum of two numbers in a previous fixed
length sub-list (part 1). Find a sub-list which sums to the number found in part 1.
